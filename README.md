# raid

This is a Django project that is being designed to assist in team selection for [Raid: Shadow Legends](https://raidshadowlegends.com/).

## Goals of the project

* Have fun working on a side project, learn something in the process, and have something useful to show for it

## Disclaimer

This is my first Django project outside the official Django tutorials. The outcome of those and the links to the tutorials can be found in my [django_tutorial](https://github.com/elandt/django_tutorial) repository.
