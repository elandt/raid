# Selling Jewelry - 7/17/2020 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg8l9XtSyyI

## General Notes

* Spider is the best way to grind Silver
* Rare Jewelry with the right # of stars and substats can be just as good as, if not better than, Epic/Legendary pieces because you know you're hitting those desired substats twice

## Rings

* ~70% of champs in Defense/HP Rings
* Attack rings are more for Arena, or nukers - need less Attack Rings
* Repeat for each primary stat
  * Filter for Attack Rings with Attack % substats - see if Attack % (or other % substats) rolls, if not, sell
  * Roll Rings to early stages (level 4) to see if you hit a % substat (ideally paired with the primary stat)
    * if rolls don't meet needs sell right away to avoid mixing with keepers
  * Earlier in the game, keep 4* and up, Defense Rings, and % substats
  * Want multiple % substats on a Ring
  * Can be more picky once you have a few good Rings for a faction - i.e. don't keep good pieces just because they're good piece if you're not going to use them
  * Once you've checked your gear, anything that's not rolled to at least 4 can be sold - double check it first

## Amulets

* Priority Primary Stats
  * Crit Damage - later game (general), damage/nukers, etc
  * Defense - earlier game (general), most of Clan Boss team
  * HP - Dungeon teams
* By Team type
  * Clan Boss - Defense (most of team) or Crit Damage
  * Dungeons - HP (keep them alive) or Crit Damage (do more damage...obviously)
* Priority Substats
  * Accuracy
  * Crit Damage - on non-Crit Damage primary stat pieces
  * Resistance - niche builds
* Selling
  * Follows a similar process to Rings
  * Primary Crit Damage w/o Accuracy
  * Primary Crit Damage w/ Accuracy, but rolls don't hit Accuracy
  * Similar for other primary stats as needed - see priorities above
  * Double check unrolled pieces after going through, and sell
  * Exceptions
    * Early game - probably keeping most Amulets
    * Simply need the Crit Damage primary stat

## Banners

* Primary Stat Priorities
  * Accuracy (4:1 ratio Acc:other Banner types)
  * Attack - Arena Nukers only
  * Resistance - niche builds
  * Defense - rarely used
  * HP
* Substat Priorities
  * Speed - golden substat
  * %
* Selling
  * Anything with a Speed substat can be viable - roll to see if Speed is hit by rolls
    * Non-Accuracy primary stat, and no Speed roll = sell
  * After checking Speed substats
    * Want Attack with Attack % - roll for Attack %, if it doesn't hit - sell
  * Exception
    * Earlier in the game, "bad" Banners might be your only options
