# Selling Artifacts - 7/12/2020 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEEPiLV9rak

## The Easy Stuff

* Instantly gone - Daze, Frost, Destroy, Toxic, Avenging, Curing
* Let new gear filter in with the rest of the gear
* Gloves, Chest, and Boots with flat HP/Attack/Defense primary stats
  * EXCEPTION: Speed substats on Speed gear that rolls the Speed substat (useful for arena) - no speed roll = trash
* Gloves: Attack % - only useful on "Bomb" champ...maybe keep a pair of gloves like this from a good set in case of future "Bomb" champ pull

## Getting Harder Now

* Filter for Weapon, Helmet, and Shield and look for combinations of bad substats - if they don't have good substats to offset, trash
  * Bad substat combos
    * Flat HP & Resistance
    * Flat Attack & Resistance
    * Flat Defense & Resistance
    * Flat HP & Flat Attack
    * Flat HP & Flat Defense
    * Flat Attack & Flat Defense
  * Good substats to check for
    * Top 3 - has to have at least one of these
      * Speed
      * Accuracy
      * Crit Rate
    * Blend of these paired with one of top 3
      * Defense %
      * HP %
      * Crit Damage - endgame is Crit Damage as primary on gloves with Crit Rate supplied as substats on the rest of your champ's gear
    * Also consider if the set of substats fits the gear set, i.e. defensive stats on offensive gear doesn't make a whole lot of sense

## Final Steps

* No gear piece filters
* Look for sets that are good, and should you have more pieces in those sets
* Life and Offense sets have upgraded versions - see notes below
* Accuracy & Crit Rate = keeper
* Accuracy & Crit Damage = becomes less valuable as you progress into endgame
* Undesirable substats even in good sets can be trash
* Accuracy & Defense % paired are good for Clan Boss - land debuffs, and be "tanky"
* Gloves with Defense % primary are premium - particulary in Clan Boss when it has Speed and Accuracy substats
* Some pieces of gear need to be rolled to determine if they're worth keeping (to see if the rolls hit good substats, or not)
  * example case: good primary, one good sub, and two bad subs
* Gloves with Crit Damage primary paired with Crit Rate or Speed substats are great endgame pieces, if they have both of those substats they're "god-like"
  * Gloves in off-sets (sets that you wouldn't get a set bonus from - like Daze, Frost, etc) can still be great
  * In good sets (Savage, Speed, Crit Damage, etc) = insanely good
  * Earlier in the game, flipping to Crit Rate primary with Crit Damage substat (paired with other good substats are even better) is also good
* Boots
  * Vast majority ("99%") of your champs will have Speed primary stats on their boots
  * Premium boots will also have a blend of the good substats - see above

## Notes on good sets

* Immunity - probably hardest set to come by, and "one of the most endgame sets," specifically for Arena, keep as much as you can - speed and crit substats
* Immortal - direct upgrade of Life set
* Cruel - direct upgrade of Offense set
* Defense - only way to build defense (as a set bonus), good to have a couple sets
  * Speed and Crit Rate even on Defensive gear is brilliant
* Speed - really want Speed on your Speed gear - probably on 95% of champs
* Accuracy - need it to be able to get Accuracy high enough to land debuffs
* Lifesteal - probably on 75% of champs until late game
* Savage - endgame set, wants Speed and Crit substats - can keep Crit Damage primary Gloves even if they had bad substats
* Stun - brilliant mid/late game set
* Stalwart - one of the more premium sets, particularly useful in Clan Boss if you have someone to keep you alive in terms of healing

## Notes on lesser/niche sets

* Life, Offense, Crit Rate - fall off in value the later into the game you get
* Crit Damage - similar to above, possible useful for boosting damage dealers, but still needs good substats, otherwise sell the piece
* Resistance - ok set, pretty niche in its usage though (high resistance builds)
* Fury - terrible set, unless the pieces are insane
* Daze - 1 or 2 sets max, only keep best in set
* Frost - can be useful in Arena, on tanks who can provoke - want defensive stats, and some speed
* Frenzy - pretty niche, 1 or 2 sets
* Regeneration - gone
* Shield - one of the best early game sets to keep you alive, keep a couple sets
* Relentless - endgame set, keep only good pieces and not much - there are better sets
* Destroy - keep "god-like" pieces only
* Toxic - maybe useful for Unkillable teams
* Avenging - keep "god-like" pieces only, maybe keep 1 set
* PVP Sets
  * Divine *set name here* - hard to farm sets, prioritize Divine Speed
  * Swift Parry - only available as high-end Arena Tier rewards?
  * Deflection - only available as high-end Arena Tier rewards?
